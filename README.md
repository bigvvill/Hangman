# Hangman v2

------------------------------------

This is the second version of my Hangman game.

I created this for practice and for fun for my kids. (The kids really enjoy playing!)

It uses text files to store the word list and the statistical data.

------------------------------------

v3 will concentrate on seperation of concerns and the DRY principle as well as using SQlite instead of the text file for keeping statistics.
